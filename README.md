![task-2 screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d31e22d0-8dd5-4c50-99ef-71bcadd1066b)



The primary objective of this project is to develop a web-based text-to-speech (TTS) application that allows users to input text and generate corresponding audio output. The application will support multiple languages and voices, providing users with options to customize the speech synthesis according to their preferences. The TTS application aims to offer an easy-to-use interface, ensuring accessibility and convenience for a wide range of users, including those with visual impairments or reading difficulties.

## Key Activities

### a. Requirements Gathering
- Identify user needs and requirements for the TTS application.
- Determine the languages and voices to be supported by the application.

### b. Design
- Design the user interface (UI) to ensure a user-friendly experience.
- Plan the application architecture, including the frontend and backend components.

### c. Implementation
- Develop the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and interactive UI.
- Implement the backend using Flask, a Python web framework, to handle text input and speech synthesis requests.
- Integrate the gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) library to perform speech synthesis.

### d. Testing
- Conduct thorough testing to ensure the application functions correctly across different browsers and devices.
- Perform usability testing to gather feedback and make necessary improvements.

### e. Deployment
- Deploy the application on a suitable web server or cloud platform.
- Ensure the application is accessible to users via a web URL.

### f. Maintenance
- Monitor the application's performance and address any issues that arise.
- Update the application to support additional languages and voices based on user feedback.

## Technologies Used

### a. Frontend Technologies
- **HTML**: Used to create the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Used to style the web pages and enhance the visual appearance.
- **JavaScript**: Used to add interactivity and handle form submissions.

### b. Backend Technologies
- **Flask**: A lightweight Python web framework used to develop the backend server and handle HTTP requests.

### c. Text-to-Speech Library
- **gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)**: A Python library that interfaces with Google's Text-to-Speech API to convert text into spoken voice.

### d. Deployment
- **Web Server/Cloud Platform**: Used to host and deploy the application, making it accessible to users online.
